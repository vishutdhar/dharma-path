    translation: "Arjuna said: O Krishna, you praise both renunciation of action and yoga of action. Tell me decisively which one is better.",

    explanation: {
      simple: "Arjuna is still confused. Krishna has praised both paths—giving up action (sannyasa) AND performing action through yoga. So which is it? Arjuna wants a clear, definitive answer: which path should I take?",
      deeper: "This question reflects a common spiritual dilemma. Should I leave the world and meditate, or stay engaged and act? Arjuna wants Krishna to pick one, but the answer will be more nuanced—showing that the apparent contradiction dissolves at a deeper level of understanding."
    },

    practicalApplication: "You might feel pulled between withdrawing from the world (meditation retreats, simplifying life) and engaging fully (career, family, service). The tension is real. Krishna is about to show that this isn't an either/or choice but a matter of understanding what true renunciation means.",

    translation: "The Supreme Lord said: Both renunciation and yoga of action lead to liberation. But of the two, yoga of action is superior to renunciation of action.",

    explanation: {
      simple: "Krishna gives a clear answer: Both paths work. Both lead to the highest good (liberation). But if you have to choose, karma yoga (selfless action) is better than simply renouncing action. Action beats inaction.",
      deeper: "'Nihshreyasa-kara' (leading to the highest good) applies to both paths—neither is invalid. But 'vishishyate' (excels, is distinguished) gives the edge to karma yoga. Why? Because renunciation without wisdom is incomplete, while selfless action naturally develops wisdom. Action is also more accessible—anyone can start where they are."
    },

    explanation: {
      simple: "Here's the secret: A true renunciant isn't defined by what they do externally but by their inner state. Someone who has no hatred and no craving, who isn't pushed around by opposites (pleasure/pain, success/failure)—that person is always a renunciant, regardless of whether they're active in the world.",

    explanation: {
      simple: "Here's the practical point: Trying to renounce without the discipline of yoga is painful and difficult. But the sage who combines wisdom with yogic practice reaches Brahman quickly. You need both—renunciation without yoga struggles; yoga makes renunciation natural.",
      deeper: "'Ayogatah sannyasa' (renunciation without yoga) is 'duhkham aptum' (difficult to achieve)—trying to give things up through willpower alone is painful and usually fails. 'Yoga-yukta muni' (the sage engaged in yoga) reaches Brahman 'na chirena' (without delay). Yoga prepares the mind; then renunciation happens naturally. Forcing renunciation before the mind is ready creates suffering."
    },

    practicalApplication: "Don't try to force renunciation. If you're not ready to give something up, forcing it creates inner conflict.

When you see yourself in everyone, how can selfish action occur? Such action 'na lipyate' (doesn't stick, doesn't taint)."

    practicalApplication: "Work on all fronts: practice discipline (yoga), purify your heart (remove negativity), master your lower impulses (self-control), and ultimately, see yourself in others.

    sanskrit: "स्पर्शान्कृत्वा बहिर्बाह्यांश्चक्षुश्चैवान्तरे भ्रुवोः।\nप्राणापानौ समौ कृत्वा नासाभ्यन्तरचारिणौ।।",
    transliteration: "sparśān kṛtvā bahir bāhyāṁś cakṣuś caivāntare bhruvoḥ\nprāṇāpānau samau kṛtvā nāsābhyantara-cāriṇau",

    translation: "Shutting out external contacts, fixing the gaze between the eyebrows, equalizing the inward and outward breaths moving within the nostrils...",

    explanation: {
      simple: "Krishna begins describing meditation technique: First, shut out external sense contacts. Fix your gaze at the point between the eyebrows. Equalize the incoming and outgoing breath in the nostrils. (Continued in next verse.)",
      deeper: "'Sparshan bahih kritva' (making contacts external)—withdrawing attention from the senses. 'Chakshuh antare bhruvoh' (gaze between eyebrows)—the ajna chakra focus point. 'Prana-apanau samau kritva' (making prana and apana equal)—breath regulation. This is a classic meditation instruction for interiorizing awareness."
    },

    practicalApplication: "This is practical meditation instruction: Close your eyes, withdraw from external stimuli, focus at the third eye point (between eyebrows), and observe your breath becoming balanced. These aren't arbitrary techniques—each element helps turn attention inward.",

    transliteration: "yatendriya-mano-buddhir munir mokṣa-parāyaṇaḥ\nvigatecchā-bhaya-krodho yaḥ sadā mukta eva saḥ",

    translation: "...with senses, mind, and intellect controlled, the sage devoted to liberation, free from desire, fear, and anger—such a one is forever free.",

    explanation: {
      simple: "The sage who has controlled senses, mind, and intellect, who is devoted to liberation, and who has released desire, fear, and anger—that person is already and always free. Liberation isn't a future event; it's a present reality for such a one.",
      deeper: "'Yata-indriya-mano-buddhi' (controlled senses, mind, intellect) covers all levels. 'Moksha-parayana' (devoted to liberation) shows focused intention. 'Vigata-iccha-bhaya-krodha' (free from desire, fear, anger)—the emotional triad that binds. 'Sada mukta eva' (forever free)—not 'will be free' but 'is always free.' The realized sage is liberated now, not after death."
    },

    practicalApplication: "Liberation isn't waiting for you after death—it's available now. The conditions: control your senses, mind, and intellect; make freedom your priority; release the grip of desire, fear, and anger. Meet these conditions, and you're free—not eventually, but presently and permanently.",

    transliteration: "bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram\nsuhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati",

    translation: "Knowing Me as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, the great Lord of all worlds, and the friend of all beings—one attains peace.",

    explanation: {
      simple: "The chapter's conclusion: Know Krishna as the receiver of all sacrifices and practices, as the supreme Lord of all worlds, and—beautifully—as the friend of all beings. Knowing this, one attains peace. God is not just cosmic ruler but intimate friend.",
      deeper: "'Bhoktaram yajna-tapasam' (enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities)—all spiritual practices ultimately reach Krishna. 'Sarva-loka-maheshvaram' (great Lord of all worlds)—cosmic sovereignty. But then 'suhridam sarva-bhutanam' (friend of all beings)—this personal, intimate touch transforms everything. God as friend means you're never alone, never unsupported. 'Jnatva mam shantim ricchati' (knowing Me, one attains peace)—this knowledge brings peace."
    },

    practicalApplication: "Don't just think of God as cosmic ruler—distant and impersonal. Know the Divine as your friend. Friends want your good, support you, are on your side. When you truly know that the Lord of the universe is your intimate well-wisher, what's left to fear? What peace can't flow from that knowledge?",

    sanskrit: "Karma Sanyasa Yoga",
    english: "The Yoga of Renunciation"
  },
  summary: "Arjuna asks which is better—renunciation of action or yoga of action. Krishna resolves this apparent conflict: both lead to liberation, but yoga of action is superior because it's more accessible. True renunciation is internal, not external. The wise person sees the same Self in all beings—from the learned brahmin to the outcaste, from cow to dog. They find happiness within, not from external contacts. The chapter concludes beautifully: know Krishna as the Lord of all worlds AND as the friend of all beings—and attain peace.",
