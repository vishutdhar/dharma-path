      deeper: "An important question: 'śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya'—setting aside scriptural rules, yet 'yajante śraddhayā anvitāḥ'—they worship endowed with faith. Many sincere people follow their hearts rather than texts. 'Teṣām niṣṭhā tu kā'—what is their standing/condition? Is their inherent faith sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic? This leads to a profound discussion of the nature of faith itself."
