    translation: "The Supreme Lord said: To you who are without envy, I shall now reveal this most secret knowledge combined with realization, knowing which you will be freed from all misfortune.",

    explanation: {
      simple: "Krishna offers Arjuna the 'most secret' knowledge (guhyatamam)—more confidential than what came before. But there's a condition: it's given to one 'without envy' (anasuyave). Open-heartedness is required to receive deep truth.",
      deeper: "Why must the recipient be 'anasuyave'? Because envy distorts perception. The envious person hears truth but twists it, sees good but resents it. Only the non-envious can receive wisdom clearly."

    explanation: {
      simple: "Now the paradox deepens: beings DON'T exist in Krishna either! First He said they do; now He says they don't. This is the divine mystery (yoga aisvara). He sustains everything yet remains independent.",
      deeper: "This isn't contradiction—it's pointing beyond logical categories. In one sense, all exists in God; in another, nothing does. The divine exceeds our either/or thinking. Both statements reveal different facets of truth."

    explanation: {
      simple: "Krishna repeatedly creates by working through prakriti. The beings are 'avasha' (helpless)—they don't choose to be born; they're propelled by nature's forces (prakriti-vashat).",

      simple: "Though Krishna creates everything, the action doesn't bind Him. He sits 'as if indifferent' (udasinavat)—not that He doesn't care, but that He's not attached to outcomes or affected by reactions.",

    practicalApplication: "You're here, in this temporary and often painful world. What will you do with this opportunity? The instruction is clear: worship. Make this life count for what lasts.",

  summary: "Krishna reveals the 'king of knowledge, king of secrets'—the most confidential teaching. He explains how he pervades everything yet remains transcendent, how he is the essence of all rituals and existence. The chapter emphasizes that social status doesn't limit spiritual access—everyone can attain the supreme through devotion. The most touching teaching: Krishna accepts even the simplest offering (leaf, flower, fruit, water) when given with love. All of life can become worship when offered to him.",
