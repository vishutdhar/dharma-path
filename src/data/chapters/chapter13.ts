      deeper: "These paired concepts form the philosophical foundation of the chapter: prakriti-purusha (matter-spirit in Sankhya philosophy), kshetra-kshetrajna (field-knower, a more practical framing), jnana-jneya (knowledge and its object). Arjuna recognizes that understanding these distinctions is essential for liberation."

  summary: "In this philosophical chapter, Krishna introduces the crucial distinction between the 'field' (kshetra—the body-mind complex) and the 'knower of the field' (kshetrajna—consciousness, the witnessing Self). Krishna describes twenty qualities that constitute true knowledge, followed by a profound description of the knowable Brahman. The chapter explores how bondage arises from the soul's identification with prakriti and how liberation comes through discriminative wisdom.",
