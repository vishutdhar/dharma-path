      deeper: "The 'ūrdhva-mūla' (upward root) Ashvattha tree is a profound metaphor. Ashvattha literally means 'that which will not remain the same tomorrow'—the ever-changing manifest world. Yet it's called 'avyaya' (imperishable) because the cycle continues endlessly. The root is Brahman above; branches are creation spreading down. 'Chandāṁsi yasya parṇāni'—Vedic hymns are leaves (they protect and nourish the tree). Understanding this structure is true Veda-knowing."

  summary: "Krishna uses the metaphor of an inverted cosmic tree to describe the manifest universe rooted in Brahman. He teaches how to cut this tree of attachment with non-attachment. The chapter introduces three categories: the perishable (kshara), the imperishable (akshara), and the Supreme Person (Purushottama) who transcends both. Understanding this is declared the most secret teaching.",
