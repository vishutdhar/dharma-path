    translation: "Let there be no distress or confusion in you from seeing this terrible form of Mine. With fear gone and mind delighted, behold again My former form.",

    explanation: {
      simple: "Krishna reassures: 'Don't be distressed or confused by this terrible form. Let fear leave, let your mind be happy. Now see My former form again.'",
      deeper: "This is divine tenderness. Krishna doesn't criticize Arjuna's fear—He responds to it. The cosmic vision was necessary but not meant to permanently traumatize. Rest is offered."
