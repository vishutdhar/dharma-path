    sanskrit: `नासदासीन्नो सदासीत्तदानीं नासीद्रजो नो व्योमा परो यत् ।
किमावरीवः कुह कस्य शर्मन्नम्भः किमासीद्गहनं गभीरम् ॥`,
    transliteration: `nāsadāsīnno sadāsīttadānīṃ nāsīdrajo no vyomā paro yat |
kimāvarīvaḥ kuha kasya śarmannambhaḥ kimāsīdgahanaṃ gabhīram ||`,
    translation: `There was neither existence nor non-existence then.
There was no realm of space, nor the sky beyond.
What covered it? Where was it? In whose protection?
Was there water, deep and unfathomable?`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Before creation, there was no "something" or "nothing" as we understand them. Even space and sky did not exist. The verse asks profound questions about what could have contained this pre-creation state.`,
      deeper: `This verse transcends the duality of being and non-being. It points to a state beyond all categories of thought — prior to existence, prior to non-existence, prior to the very framework that makes such distinctions possible.`,
    },
    practicalApplication: `When you feel certain about having all the answers, remember that reality's foundation is mysterious. Intellectual humility opens us to deeper understanding.`,

आनीदवातं स्वधया तदेकं तस्माद्धान्यन्न परः किञ्चनास ॥`,
    transliteration: `na mṛtyurāsīdamṛtaṃ na tarhi na rātryā ahna āsītpraketaḥ |
ānīdavātaṃ svadhayā tadekaṃ tasmāddhānyannapara ḥkiñcanāsa ||`,
    translation: `There was neither death nor immortality then.
There was no sign of night or day.
That One breathed, windless, by its own power.
Other than That, there was nothing else.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `In the primordial state, there was no death because there was no life, no immortality because time hadn't begun. Only "That One" existed, self-sustained, breathing without air — a paradoxical image of pure potentiality.`,
      deeper: `"Breathing without wind" suggests consciousness or life-force that needs no external support. This "That One" (tad ekam) is the ultimate reality beyond all dualities — neither mortal nor immortal, neither temporal nor eternal in our sense.`,
    },
    practicalApplication: `The source of all life sustains itself without external support. When you feel dependent on circumstances, remember there is a deeper source within that is self-sufficient.`,

    translation: `In the beginning, darkness was hidden by darkness.
All this was an indistinguishable water.
That which was covered by emptiness —
That One arose through the power of heat (tapas).`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Before creation, there was only darkness within darkness — no distinguishing features. Everything was like a formless ocean. From this, through the concentrated power of tapas (heat/austerity), the One emerged.`,
      deeper: `Tapas here means concentrated creative energy or cosmic incubation. The image of darkness hidden in darkness suggests that even concealment was concealed — reality beyond any perception. From this absolute mystery, manifestation arose.`,
    },
    practicalApplication: `Great things emerge from periods of darkness and incubation. When life feels unclear or you're in a "dark night," trust that creative energy may be gathering for emergence.`,

    translation: `In the beginning, desire arose —
The first seed of mind.
Sages, searching in their hearts with wisdom,
Found the connection between existence and non-existence.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Desire (kama) was the first impulse that set creation in motion — the original seed of consciousness. The ancient sages, through deep contemplation, discovered the link between being and non-being.`,
      deeper: `Kama here is not ordinary desire but the primordial creative impulse — the will to manifest. The sages (kavis) found this truth not through external observation but through inner search, in the heart (hṛdi). The connection between sat and asat was realized inwardly.`,

    translation: `Their ray was extended across —
Was it below? Was it above?
There were seed-placers, there were powers.
Self-power below, impulse above.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `A creative ray stretched across the primordial state, though whether it went up or down couldn't be determined. Creative forces and great powers existed, with inherent nature below and creative impulse above.`,
      deeper: `The verse describes the differentiation within the One — the emergence of polarity and creative tension. The horizontal ray suggests manifestation into extension. The uncertainty of "above" and "below" shows that spatial orientation emerged along with creation.`,
    },

    translation: `Who really knows? Who can say here
From where this creation arose, from where it came?
The gods came later, after the creation of this world.
So who knows from where it came into being?`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `This remarkable verse admits uncertainty even about ultimate questions. Who can truly know the origin of creation? Even the gods came after creation, so they cannot know what preceded them.`,
      deeper: `The hymn's intellectual honesty is extraordinary. Rather than claiming definitive knowledge, it acknowledges the limits of all knowing. The gods themselves are products of creation and therefore cannot witness what came before. This is not despair but profound humility.`,

    practicalApplication: `It's okay not to have all the answers. Even the wisest traditions acknowledge mystery. Embrace uncertainty as a doorway to wonder rather than a problem to be solved.`,

yo asyādhyakṣaḥ parame vyoman tso aṅga veda yadi vā na veda ||`,
    translation: `This creation, from where it arose —
Whether it was made or whether it was not —
He who surveys it from the highest heaven,
He alone knows. Or perhaps even He does not know.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `The hymn ends with the ultimate question mark. Even the supreme overseer in the highest heaven may or may not know the origin of creation. This is the most profound acknowledgment of cosmic mystery in all of scripture.`,
      deeper: `"Perhaps even He does not know" (yadi vā na veda) is one of the most remarkable statements in religious literature. It suggests that the mystery of existence may be so profound that even ultimate consciousness encounters it as mystery. This is not atheism but the deepest form of reverence.`,
    },
    practicalApplication: `The greatest wisdom includes knowing what we don't know. In the face of life's ultimate mysteries, wonder is more appropriate than certainty. Let mystery inspire awe rather than anxiety.`,

    sanskrit: 'नासदीय सूक्त',

  },

  veda: 'rig',
  reference: 'Rig Veda 10.129',

  summary: `The Nasadiya Sukta is one of the most philosophically profound hymns in world literature. Composed over 3,000 years ago, it contemplates the mystery of creation with remarkable intellectual honesty and humility. Rather than providing definitive answers, it raises profound questions about the origin of existence — questions that remain unanswered even today.`,

  significance: `This hymn is celebrated for its extraordinary admission of uncertainty. Unlike most creation accounts that claim definitive knowledge, the Nasadiya Sukta acknowledges that even the gods cannot know what preceded creation, and perhaps not even the highest being knows. This intellectual honesty and cosmic humility have inspired philosophers and scientists for millennia.`,
