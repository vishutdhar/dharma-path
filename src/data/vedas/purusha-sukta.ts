    translation: `The Cosmic Person has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet.
He pervades the earth on all sides and extends beyond it by ten fingers' breadth.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Purusha, the Cosmic Person, is infinite — "thousand" means countless. He has infinite awareness (eyes), infinite thought (heads), and infinite activity (feet). Though he pervades everything, he also transcends it.`,
      deeper: `The "ten fingers beyond" suggests that reality transcends what can be measured or grasped. Purusha is both immanent (pervading all) and transcendent (beyond all). This is the foundation of Hindu panentheism — God is in everything, yet greater than everything.`,
    },
    practicalApplication: `Recognize the divine in all beings — every person you meet has "a thousand eyes" of awareness. This infinite presence is closer than your own breath, yet vaster than the universe.`,

    translation: `Purusha is all this — what has been and what will be.
He is the lord of immortality, and also of that which grows by food.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Everything that exists, has existed, or will exist is Purusha. He is the master of the immortal realm (the eternal) and also of the mortal realm (that which needs food to grow). Both the unchanging and the changing are aspects of him.`,
      deeper: `This verse establishes Purusha as the totality of time — past, present, and future. He transcends the duality of mortal and immortal, being the source of both. The reference to "food" (anna) connects to the cycle of life and death in the material world.`,

    translation: `Such is his greatness, yet Purusha is greater still.
One quarter of him is all beings; three quarters are the immortal in heaven.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `The entire manifest universe — all beings, all worlds — is only one-fourth of Purusha. Three-fourths remains unmanifest, eternal, in the divine realm. What we see is a fraction of ultimate reality.`,
      deeper: `This profound cosmology suggests that the visible universe is a small expression of infinite potential. The "three quarters in heaven" represents the unmanifest Brahman — pure potentiality that never enters manifestation. Creation is a partial expression, not a diminishment, of the divine.`,

    transliteration: `tripādūrdhva udaitpuruṣaḥ pādo'syehābhavatpunaḥ |

    translation: `Three quarters of Purusha rose upward; one quarter came into being here again.
From this he spread in all directions, into that which eats and that which does not eat.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `While three-fourths of Purusha remained transcendent, one-fourth manifested as the universe. This manifest portion then diversified into all forms — both living (that which eats) and non-living (that which does not eat).`,
      deeper: `The hymn describes creation as a "spreading out" (vyakrāmat) rather than a making from nothing. The divine unfolds into multiplicity while remaining whole. The distinction between eaters and non-eaters captures the entire range of existence from conscious beings to inert matter.`,

    transliteration: `tasmādvirāḻajāyata virājo adhi pūruṣaḥ |
sa jāto atyaricyata paścādbhūmimathopuraḥ ||`,
    translation: `From him was born Viraj (the shining one); from Viraj came Purusha again.
When born, he extended beyond the earth, behind and before.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `From Purusha came Viraj (the cosmic creative power), and from Viraj, Purusha manifested again. This mutual arising shows that creator and creation are not separate — they give rise to each other. The born Purusha then pervaded all space.`,
      deeper: `This verse describes a reciprocal creation — Purusha and Viraj emerge from each other. This is not linear causation but cyclical interdependence, like the chicken and egg. It points to the mystery that the absolute and the manifest world are mutually implicated.`,

vasanto asyāsīdājyaṃ grīṣma idhmaḥ śaraddhaviḥ ||`,
    translation: `When the gods performed the sacrifice with Purusha as the offering,
spring was the clarified butter, summer was the fuel, and autumn was the oblation.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `The gods performed a cosmic sacrifice using Purusha himself as the offering. The seasons participated: spring provided the ghee (clarified butter), summer the firewood, and autumn the main offering. This is the primordial yajna (sacrifice) that created the world.`,
      deeper: `This metaphor reveals that creation is an act of self-offering. The cosmos arises through divine self-sacrifice — not violence but generous self-giving. The seasons as ritual elements show that time itself is part of the offering.`,
    },
    practicalApplication: `Life asks for your offering — not martyrdom, but generous participation. Like the seasons, give what is yours to give: your energy, your creativity, your presence. Creation happens through giving.`,

    translation: `They sprinkled on the sacred grass that sacrifice, Purusha, born in the beginning.
With him the gods sacrificed, the Sadhyas, and the seers.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Purusha, the first-born being, was consecrated on the sacred grass (the altar). The gods (devas), the Sadhyas (celestial beings), and the ancient seers (rishis) all participated in this primordial sacrifice.`,
      deeper: `The participation of gods and rishis suggests that even divine beings are part of this cosmic drama — they too arise from and participate in the sacrifice. No one stands outside the process; all beings are both sacrificers and sacrificed.`,

    translation: `From that sacrifice completely offered, the dripping fat was collected.
He made the animals of the air, of the forest, and of the village.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `From the complete cosmic sacrifice came the essence (like clarified butter dripping from the offering). From this, all animals were created — birds, wild animals, and domestic animals.`,
      deeper: `The "dripping fat" (pṛṣadājya) symbolizes the essence or vitality that flows from self-sacrifice. Animal life in all its diversity — aerial, wild, and tame — emerges from this essence. Creation is the overflow of generous self-giving.`,
    },

The meters were born from it; from it the Yajur formulas arose.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `From the cosmic sacrifice, the Vedas themselves were born — the Rig Veda hymns, the Sama Veda melodies, the poetic meters, and the Yajur Veda ritual formulas. Sacred knowledge itself emerged from this primordial offering.`,
      deeper: `This reveals that the Vedas are not human compositions but cosmic emanations. Language, poetry, music, and ritual all flow from the same source as the physical universe. Knowledge is as fundamental as matter.`,

Cattle were born from it; from it were born goats and sheep.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `The cosmic sacrifice also produced specific animals essential to Vedic life: horses (vital for mobility and ritual), cattle (sacred and sustaining), goats, and sheep. These weren't random but specifically important to the culture.`,
      deeper: `The mention of "two rows of teeth" (both upper and lower) distinguishes horses from cattle (which lack upper incisors). This specificity shows the hymn's attention to the real natural world while describing cosmic origins.`,

What became of his mouth? What of his arms? What are his thighs and feet called?`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `The hymn now asks: how was Purusha divided? What came from his mouth, arms, thighs, and feet? This sets up the explanation of how different aspects of society emerged from different parts of the cosmic person.`,
      deeper: `This is a rhetorical question — the seer asks so he can answer. The division of Purusha into body parts will correspond to cosmic and social functions. Note that this is cosmic symbolism, not a prescription for social hierarchy.`,

      deeper: `Originally, this described functional differentiation, not birth-based caste.

  },

  veda: 'rig',
  reference: 'Rig Veda 10.90',

  summary: `The Purusha Sukta describes how the universe emerged from the primordial cosmic being, Purusha, through a cosmic sacrifice. It presents creation as an act of divine self-offering, explaining the origin of animals, elements, the Vedas, cosmic bodies, and social order — all arising from different parts of the one infinite being.`,

  significance: `This is one of the most important hymns in the Vedas, recited daily in temples and rituals across India. It establishes fundamental Hindu concepts: the universe as the body of God, creation through sacrifice, the correspondence between microcosm and macrocosm, and the organic unity of society. Though later misused to justify caste rigidity, the original teaching emphasizes the interdependence of all functions in the cosmic body.`,
