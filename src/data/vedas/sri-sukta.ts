    translation: `Of golden hue, beautiful as a deer, adorned with gold and silver garlands,
radiant as the moon, golden Lakshmi — O Jataveda (Fire), bring her to me.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `The hymn opens by describing Lakshmi's radiant beauty — she is golden-colored, graceful like a deer, adorned with precious metals, and luminous like the moon. Agni (fire, called Jataveda) is asked to bring her to the worshipper.`,
      deeper: `Gold symbolizes purity, permanence, and spiritual wealth. The deer represents grace and gentleness. The moon (candra) represents cooling, nourishing presence. Jataveda means "knower of all creatures" — fire that carries offerings to the gods and brings blessings back.`,

through whom I may obtain gold, cattle, horses, and servants.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `The worshipper asks for Lakshmi who is "anapagāminī" — one who doesn't leave. This is permanent prosperity, not fleeting luck. The blessings requested are the traditional markers of Vedic wealth: gold, cattle, horses, and household.`,
      deeper: `"Anapagāminī" (never-departing) is the key word. True prosperity stays — it's not windfall luck that vanishes. The Vedic list of wealth includes living beings (cattle, horses, people) not just inert gold, showing wealth as relationship and responsibility.`,

      deeper: `The imagery shows wealth as active, dynamic, arriving with fanfare. Elephants in Indian tradition represent royalty, wisdom, and auspiciousness (Ganesha). The prayer "śrīr mā devī juṣatām" (may Sri be pleased with me) shows prosperity as a relationship requiring mutual favor.`,

      deeper: `"Tṛptā tarpayantī" (content and contentment-giving) is profound — true prosperity is both having enough and giving enough. The lotus symbolizes purity amid worldly waters. "Ārdrā" (moist/tender) shows the goddess as compassionate, not cold.`,

    explanation: {
      simple: `Lakshmi shines like the moon, glows with fame and glory, is worshipped even by the gods, and is generous (udārā). The worshipper takes refuge in her, prays for the destruction of misfortune (alakṣmī), and consciously chooses her.`,
      deeper: `"Alakṣmī" (misfortune, the opposite of Lakshmi) is directly addressed — asking not just for fortune but for the removal of its opposite. "Tvāṃ vṛṇe" (I choose you) shows prosperity as an active choice, not passive luck.`,

    translation: `O sun-colored one, from your tapas was born the lord of the forest — the bilva tree.
May its fruits, through austerity, drive away inner and outer misfortune.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Lakshmi is addressed as sun-colored (āditya-varṇa). The sacred bilva (bael) tree is said to have arisen from her spiritual power (tapas). The bilva fruit is prayed to remove both internal (māyā, illusion) and external (alakṣmī) obstacles.`,
      deeper: `The bilva tree is sacred to Shiva, and this verse connects Lakshmi's power to it — showing the interconnection of divine energies. "Māyā" here means delusion/inner obstacles, while "alakṣmī" is external misfortune. True prosperity addresses both.`,

      deeper: `Kubera represents organized, established wealth — he is the divine treasurer. "Prādurbhūto'smi" (I have manifested) is a powerful declaration of presence and worthiness. Fame (kīrti) and prosperity (ṛddhi) are both requested — spiritual and material success together.`,

    translation: `I destroy the elder sister Alakshmi, who is stained by hunger and thirst.
Drive out from my home all non-prosperity and lack of abundance.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Alakshmi (misfortune) is called "jyeṣṭhā" (elder sister) — in mythology, she emerged before Lakshmi. She is characterized by hunger and thirst — the experience of lack. The worshipper actively destroys her and asks for all poverty to leave the home.`,
      deeper: `The mythology says Jyeshtha (Alakshmi) emerged from the churning of the ocean before Lakshmi — misfortune precedes fortune. She must be consciously released. "Gṛhāt" (from my home) makes this personal and domestic — prosperity begins at home.`,

the sovereign of all beings — I invoke that Sri here.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Lakshmi's gateway is gandha (fragrance) — abundance announces itself through pleasant scents. She is durādharṣā (unconquerable), always well-nourished, and karīṣiṇī (possessing fertile earth/cow dung, symbol of agricultural wealth). She rules all beings.`,
      deeper: `"Gandhadvārā" (fragrance as doorway) is beautiful — prosperity has a scent, an aura. "Karīṣiṇī" refers to cow dung, which in Vedic culture represents fertile soil and agricultural wealth. Lakshmi is īśvarī (sovereign) — wealth gives power.`,

    explanation: {
      simple: `A prayer for the fulfillment of mental desires (kāma) and intentions (ākūti), for truthful speech, for livestock, and for food. The verse ends with asking Sri and fame (yaśas) to take shelter in the worshipper.`,
      deeper: `The progression is significant: mind (desires/intentions) → speech (truth) → material (cattle/food). Prosperity flows from thought through word to manifestation. "Śrīḥ śrayatām" (may Sri take refuge) reverses the typical prayer — the divine takes shelter in the devotee.`,

      simple: `Kardama is the sage-son of Lakshmi, associated with fertile soil (kardama = mud/clay). He represents generative power. The prayer asks for his presence and for the lotus-garlanded mother Lakshmi to permanently dwell in the worshipper's family line.`,

  reference: 'Rig Veda (Khilani/Appendix)',

  summary: `The Sri Sukta is one of the most widely chanted hymns for invoking prosperity, wealth, and the blessings of goddess Lakshmi. It describes her radiant beauty, her qualities of compassion and generosity, and prays for permanent abundance that benefits the entire family lineage.`,

  significance: `Considered essential for material and spiritual prosperity, the Sri Sukta is recited during Diwali, Lakshmi puja, homas (fire rituals), and whenever abundance is sought. Unlike some prosperity prayers, it emphasizes "anapagāminī" — Lakshmi who never departs, indicating stable rather than fleeting fortune. The hymn also addresses Alakshmi (misfortune), making it a complete practice for both inviting good and releasing bad.`,
