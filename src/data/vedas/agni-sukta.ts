    sanskrit: `अग्निमीळे पुरोहितं यज्ञस्य देवमृत्विजम् ।
होतारं रत्नधातमम् ॥`,

hotāraṃ ratnadhātamam ||`,
    translation: `I praise Agni, the household priest, the divine minister of the sacrifice,
the invoker, bestower of treasures.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `The Rig Veda opens with praise to Agni — fire personified as divine priest. Agni serves as purohita (the priest who goes before), the god of sacrifice, and the invoker who carries offerings to the gods. He bestows wealth and blessings.`,
      deeper: `That the Vedas begin with Agni reveals fire's central role in Vedic religion. Agni is the intermediary between human and divine realms — the sacrificial fire that transforms offerings and carries them heavenward. "Ratnadhātama" (bestower of treasures) suggests both material and spiritual wealth.`,
    },
    practicalApplication: `Begin important endeavors with invocation — set your intention like lighting a sacred fire. The first words matter; they establish the tone for what follows. What you honor first shapes everything after.`,

स देवाँ एह वक्षति ॥`,
    transliteration: `agniḥ pūrvebhir ṛṣibhir īḍyo nūtanair uta |
sa devāṃ eha vakṣati ||`,
    translation: `Agni, worthy of praise by ancient seers and by modern ones alike —
may he bring the gods here.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Agni has been praised by the rishis of old and continues to be worthy of praise today. His function is eternal — to bring the gods to the sacrifice. The tradition connects past and present through the same sacred fire.`,
      deeper: `This establishes continuity of tradition. The "ancient seers" (pūrve ṛṣayaḥ) and "modern ones" (nūtana) are united in their praise of Agni. The fire on your altar is the same fire that burned for your ancestors. Tradition is a living flame.`,

yaśasaṃ vīravattamam ||`,
    translation: `Through Agni one may obtain wealth, prosperity day by day,
glory and heroic offspring.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Through proper worship of Agni, one gains material wealth (rayi), daily nourishment and growth (poṣa), fame (yaśas), and strong descendants (vīra). These are the traditional blessings sought in Vedic religion.`,
      deeper: `"Dive-dive" (day by day) emphasizes that blessing is continuous, not a one-time gift. The Vedic vision of the good life includes material prosperity, social standing, and continuation through children. These are not considered unspiritual but as expressions of divine favor.`,
    },
    practicalApplication: `Consistent daily practice yields cumulative results. "Day by day" is the key — small, regular offerings build lasting prosperity. Don't seek dramatic breakthroughs; seek steady, sustainable growth.`,

sa id deveṣu gacchati ||`,
    translation: `O Agni, the sacrifice which you encompass on every side —
that indeed goes to the gods.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Whatever sacrifice Agni surrounds and protects reaches the gods. Agni's presence validates and completes the ritual. Without fire, the offering cannot reach its divine destination.`,
      deeper: `"Viśvataḥ paribhūḥ" (encompassing on all sides) shows Agni as the protective circle around the sacred space. The sacrifice exists within the embrace of fire. This is both physical (the fire altar) and metaphysical (divine protection of the ritual).`,

    translation: `Agni the invoker, of poetic wisdom, true, of most brilliant fame —
may he, the god, come with the gods.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Agni is the hotā (invoker), possessed of kavikratu (the wisdom of a poet-seer), satya (truthful), and of brilliant fame. The prayer asks that he come accompanied by all the gods.`,
      deeper: `"Kavikratu" links Agni to poetic inspiration — fire as the source of illuminated speech. Agni is "satya" (true) because fire cannot lie; it transforms everything it touches. His fame (śravas) is "citra" (brilliant, variegated) like flames.`,
    },

tavet tat satyam aṅgiraḥ ||`,
    translation: `Whatever good you will do for the worshipper, O Agni —
that indeed is true, O Angiras.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Whatever blessing Agni grants to the sincere worshipper (dāśuṣe — one who gives) is certain to come true. Agni is addressed as Angiras, connecting him to the priestly family of that name.`,
      deeper: `The relationship is reciprocal: "dāśuṣe" is one who gives, who offers. Agni responds to generosity with generosity. The promise is "satya" (true, certain) — divine reciprocity is reliable. The name Angiras links Agni to the legendary priests of that lineage.`,
    },
    practicalApplication: `What you give returns. The universe responds to generosity with blessing. But the giving must be genuine (dāśuṣe implies willing, devoted giving, not grudging obligation).`,

namo bharanta emasi ||`,
    translation: `To you, O Agni, day by day, at dusk and dawn,
we come bearing homage with our thoughts.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `The worshippers approach Agni every day, at evening (doṣā) and morning (uṣṭar), bringing their mental focus (dhiyā) and reverence (namas). This is the daily rhythm of Vedic worship.`,
      deeper: `"Dive-dive" again emphasizes daily practice. "Dhiyā" (with thought/meditation) shows that worship is not mere ritual but engaged consciousness. "Namas" (homage, bowing) combines with "emasi" (we come) — worship is an active approach, not passive waiting.`,
    },
    practicalApplication: `Establish a daily rhythm of spiritual practice — morning and evening, day after day. Come with both body (emasi) and mind (dhiyā). Consistency and attention together create transformation.`,

vardhamānaṃ sve dame ||`,
    translation: `Ruling over sacrifices, guardian of cosmic order, shining bright,
growing strong in your own house.`,
    explanation: {
      simple: `Agni is the king (rājan) of sacrifices, the protector (gopā) of ṛta (cosmic order/truth), brilliantly shining (dīdivi), and growing in strength within his own dwelling (the altar, the home).`,
      deeper: `Agni as "gopā ṛtasya" (guardian of cosmic order) is profound — fire upholds the natural law. "Sve dame" (in his own house) refers to both the altar and the household hearth. Agni grows stronger the more he is fed — a metaphor for how tended devotion increases.`,

    explanation: {
      simple: `The hymn closes with a tender request: be approachable (sūpāyana) like a father to his child. Agni is asked to remain present (sacasva) for the worshippers' welfare (svasti). The divine is accessible, not remote.`,
      deeper: `The father-son metaphor transforms the divine relationship from fearful awe to intimate trust. "Sūpāyana" (easy to approach) counters any sense of divine remoteness. "Svasti" (well-being, blessing) comes from "su" (good) + "asti" (being) — simply being well.`,

  summary: `The Agni Sukta is the very first hymn of the Rig Veda, establishing fire as the central deity of Vedic religion. Addressed to Agni, the divine priest and messenger between humans and gods, it invokes blessings of wealth, prosperity, and well-being through daily worship at dawn and dusk.`,

  significance: `As the opening hymn of humanity's oldest religious text, the Agni Sukta sets the tone for all of Vedic spirituality. It establishes fire not just as an element but as a divine person — priest, messenger, guardian of cosmic order, and accessible like a father. This hymn has been recited daily for over 3,000 years in Hindu ritual.`,
